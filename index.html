        <h2>Life's Not a Tip Jar</h2>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>Here's a fun fact: Life doesn't give out tips for doing the bare minimum. I know, I know—it's shocking. But if you're standing there, staring at your screen while someone asks you for a tip for "helping" them with something they were already paid to do, don't feel guilty for saying no.</p>
          <p class="emphasis-text">They're not entitled to your cash because they pressed a button or handed you your coffee with a fake smile.</p>
          <p>If your job is to serve me, guess what? Your paycheck is for doing your job. The tip? That's for going above and beyond. If you think you're going to get a bonus for doing the minimum, then congratulations—you've misunderstood the basic principle of capitalism. You're not entitled to a damn thing.</p>

        <h2>Hard Earners: The People Who Actually Do Things</h2>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>Here's a little secret about us hard earners: We don't ask for handouts. We don't beg for tips. We don't sit around waiting for someone to "give us a break" or bail us out of our mess. We get up, do the work, and make something of ourselves.</p>
          <p class="emphasis-text">So when the entitled people start looking at us like we owe them, we just smile. Because we know they're the ones with the problem, not us.</p>
          <p>And if you're one of the people who thinks they deserve money for doing absolutely nothing, I've got a question for you: Why do you think anyone would reward your laziness?</p>
